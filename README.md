**Rock–Paper–Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

HTML creates buttons for Rock, Paper, Scissor, and Reset, plus areas to display the result, moves, and score.

CSS centers the game on the page and adds basic styling.

**JavaScript handles the game logic:**

The computer picks a random move.
The winner is decided based on the rules.
The score (wins, losses, draws) is updated and saved in localStorage so it doesn’t reset on refresh.
The Reset button clears the score and storage.
